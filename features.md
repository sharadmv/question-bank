A general overview:

The general user is someone who is looking to either review 61A concepts or for
an extra challenge. So, at it's core, it's just a list of questions with answers.
Any features that we add should have the purpose to make going through this list
easier or make it more fun.

---FEATURE DESCRIPTIONS---

1) User Login

So... the idea is that if someone is going to be using this frequently, they might
want to keep track of some things or have it customized to their liking.

A user should be able to login. After logging in, the user should be able to see
which questions they are working on, what they are done with, which ones they 
have seen and which ones are new/unread to them. Also, they should be able to 
see which people in their section are working on the same question. They should
also be able to set if they want to be seen, change their section as well as their
name/login.

2) Question Formats

There are three basic question formats (feel free to add more categories as they come up):
	a) Numerical:   This is basically anything that is satisfied by a simple numerical
		        answer. Think projecteuler questions here.

	b) Programming: This is basically anything that requires a piece of code to be
			written and evaluated. So, any algorithms questions would go here.
			These will be tested using unit tests, and we need to be pretty
			careful here since we can't go back and add more tests since that
			would break solutions that were previously deemed correct.

	c) Other:       Thse are pretty much any other kind of question. We'll rely on the
			student/user to self-grade these questions.

3) Search/Filter:

This is so that a user can spend more time working on the questions rather than search through
questions and pick the ones they like.

A user should be able to search through the questions and pick out ones that they want to work on.
Also, they should be able to filter questions so that only questions of a certain type will
show up or something like that.

[I think Sharad had a good idea using some tags that he could do...]
